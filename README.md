TRAF (Translating Acoustic Signal through Radio Frequency communication)
Wireless communication breaks through water-air barrier. Underwater sonar signals cause vibrations
that can be decoded by an airborne receiver.
It’s a step toward solving a longstanding challenge with wireless communication: direct data
transmission between underwater and airborne devices. It’s been designed a system that tackles this problem in
a novel way. An underwater transmitter directs a sonar signal to the water’s surface, causing vibrations that
correspond to transmitted. Above the surface, a highly sensitive receiver reads these minute disturbances and
decodes the sonar signal.
Underwater sensors cannot share data with those on land, as both use different wireless signals that only
work in their respective mediums. Radio signals that travel through air die very rapidly in water. Acoustic
signals, or sonar, sent by underwater devices mostly reflect off the surface without ever breaking through. This
causes inefficiencies and other issues for a variety of applications, such as ocean exploration and submarine-to-
plane communication.
